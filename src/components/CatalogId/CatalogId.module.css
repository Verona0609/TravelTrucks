/* This is a great opportunity to take my first step into the Swiss IT market. I have an IT background and understand that success requires hard work. As an immigrant, I know I need to work even harder — and I’m ready for that. I have the motivation, strength, and discipline to succeed. After many rejections, I realized I need a different approach. Powercoders offers the support and structure I need to start my IT career */

/* My background in dance taught me strong self-discipline — a skill that I now apply in IT. It helps me stay focused, overcome laziness, and keep going even when things get tough. I don’t give up easily, and I’m ready to bring this mindset to the Bootcamp. */

/* I’m proud of completing a Junior Fullstack Developer course at GoIT. It was a big challenge — a completely new field for me. I took a risk, followed my curiosity, and didn’t let fear stop me. That step changed everything for me — now I can’t imagine my life without coding. */

/*I completed my first IT course (Junior Fullstack Developer) and, after researching the Swiss job market, I started learning Azure on Udemy by myself. Over the past three years, I’ve learned German to level B2. I also improved my English to B1+ and continue studying it twice a week. */

/* I’ve applied for over 20 jobs but have only received rejections so far. One main barrier is my limited experience — some companies mentioned that it’s not enough. I also believe the lack of a Swiss technical degree and experience in the local job market play a role. */
